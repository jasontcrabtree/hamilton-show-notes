## Wikipedia Synopsis

**_Hamilton_** is a musical with music, lyrics, and book by [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin-Manuel_Miranda). It is inspired by the 2004 biography _[Alexander Hamilton](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton_(book)>)\_ by historian [Ron Chernow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Chernow).

The musical tells the story of American [Founding Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States) [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton) through music that draws heavily from [hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop), as well as [R&B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B), [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music), [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music), and [traditional-style show tunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_tune); the show also incorporates color-conscious casting of [non-white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color) actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures.[[1\]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)#cite_note-Cote-1>)[[2\]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)#cite_note-mead-2>)[[3\]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)#cite_note-atlantic-3>) Through this use of modern storytelling methods, _Hamilton_ has been described as being about "America then, as told by America now."[[4\]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)#cite_note-4>)

The musical details Hamilton's life in two acts, along with how various historical characters influenced his life such as [Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette), [Aaron Burr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr), [John Laurens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Laurens), [Hercules Mulligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_Mulligan), [Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Schuyler_Hamilton), [Angelica Schuyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica_Schuyler), [Peggy Schuyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Schuyler), [Philip Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hamilton), and former presidents [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington), [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison), and [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson).

### Act I

The orphan [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton) leaves his home on the [island of Nevis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_Nevis) ("[Alexander Hamilton](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton_(song)>)"). After arriving in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets [Aaron Burr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr), [John Laurens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Laurens), [Marquis de Lafayette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette), and [Hercules Mulligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_Mulligan) ("[Aaron Burr, Sir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr,_Sir)"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills ("[My Shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Shot)"). They affirm their revolutionary goals to each other ("[The Story of Tonight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Tonight)"). Meanwhile, wealthy sisters [Angelica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica_Schuyler_Church), [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Schuyler_Hamilton), and [Peggy Schuyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Schuyler) go into town seeking out potential suitors ("[The Schuyler Sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Schuyler_Sisters)"). [Samuel Seabury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Seabury) warns everyone about the dangers of Congress, but Hamilton disagrees and tries to counter Seabury ("[Farmer Refuted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer_Refuted)"). [King George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom) then insists on his authority ("[You'll Be Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You'll_Be_Back)"). During the [New York and New Jersey campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_and_New_Jersey_campaign), Hamilton accepts a position as [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington)'s [aide-de-camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aide-de-camp) ("[Right Hand Man](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Hand_Man_(Hamilton_song)>)"), instead of field command.

At Philip Schuyler's ball ("A Winter's Ball"), Hamilton meets, falls in love with, and later marries Eliza Schuyler ("[Helpless](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helpless_(Hamilton_song)>)"), as Angelica suppresses her feelings for the sake of their happiness at the wedding ("[Satisfied](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfied_(Hamilton_song)>)"). After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton confesses that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield ("[The Story of Tonight (Reprise)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Tonight_(Reprise)>)"). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own career as more cautious ("[Wait For It](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_for_It_(song)>)").

As conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a [duel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel) against [Charles Lee](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lee_(general)>) ("Stay Alive"), who insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who in turn yields ("[Ten Duel Commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Duel_Commandments)"). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington ("Meet Me Inside") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives ("That Would Be Enough"). After Lafayette convinces France to get involved on the colonists' side ("Guns and Ships"), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final [Siege of Yorktown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown). Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton—who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war—that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come ("[History Has Its Eyes on You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_Has_Its_Eyes_on_You)"). At the [Siege of Yorktown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown), Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out what to do to trap the British and win the war ("[Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorktown_(The_World_Turned_Upside_Down)>)").

Soon after the victory at Yorktown, King George asks the rebels how they will succeed in governing on their own (“[What Comes Next?](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=What_Comes_Next%3F&action=edit&redlink=1)”). Hamilton's son [Philip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hamilton) is born, while Burr has a daughter, [Theodosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosia_Burr_Alston), and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them ("[Dear Theodosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear_Theodosia)"). Hamilton receives word that his friend Laurens has been killed in [a seemingly pointless battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Combahee_River) after the war was won and throws himself into his work ("[Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_There'll_Be_More_of_Us)"). He co-authors _[The Federalist Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers)_ and is selected as [Secretary of the Treasury](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury_(United_States)>) by newly elected President Washington. Eliza begs Hamilton to stay. Angelica moves to London with her new husband ("Non-Stop").

### Act II

[Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson) returns to America from being the [U.S. ambassador to France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_France) ("What'd I Miss"). In 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate the latter's financial proposals at a [Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States) meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside, and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress ("[Cabinet Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Battle) #1").

Eliza and her family—along with Angelica, back from London—travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise ("Take a Break"). Hamilton [begins an affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton–Reynolds_sex_scandal) with [Maria Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Reynolds), making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail ("[Say No To This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say_No_To_This)"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison) create the [Compromise of 1790](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790) over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes he had similar power ("[The Room Where It Happens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Room_Where_It_Happens)"). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler, making Hamilton now a rival ("Schuyler Defeated").

In another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its [conflict with Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_First_Coalition). President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining [neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_Neutrality) ("[Cabinet Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Battle) #2"). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton in Washington's eyes ("Washington on Your Side"). Washington decides to retire from the presidency, and Hamilton assists in writing a [farewell address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington's_Farewell_Address) ("[One Last Time](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Last_Time_(Hamilton)>)").

A flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by [Paris](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)>) signatory [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams) (“I Know Him”). John Adams [becomes the second President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1796_United_States_presidential_election) and fires Hamilton, who publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president as a response ("[The Adams Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adams_Administration)"). In the face of accusations of speculation of government funds by Jefferson, Madison, and Burr—and out of fear that his affair with Maria Reynolds will be used against him in his political career ("We Know")—Hamilton chooses to publicize his affair ("Hurricane") in the Reynolds Pamphlet ("[The Reynolds Pamphlet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reynolds_Pamphlet_(song)>)"), damaging his relationship with Eliza ("Burn"). Philip, instructed by Hamilton, challenges [George Eacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eacker) to a duel and is critically injured ("Blow Us All Away") and dies ("Stay Alive (Reprise)"), causing a reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza ("[It's Quiet Uptown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Quiet_Uptown)").

Hamilton's endorsement of Jefferson in [the presidential election of 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election) ("The Election of 1800") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who [challenges Hamilton to a duel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr–Hamilton_duel) via an exchange of letters ("[Your Obedient Servant](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Obedient_Servant_(song)>)"). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (“Best of Wives and Best of Women”). Burr and Hamilton travel to New Jersey for the duel. During the duel, both Burr and Hamilton fire at each other after ten paces, with Hamilton intentionally missing his shot. Hamilton dies as a result, with Eliza and Angelica at his side. Burr laments that even though he survived, he is cursed to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton ("[The World Was Wide Enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Was_Wide_Enough)"). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory, showing how Eliza kept Hamilton's legacy alive ("[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Lives,_Who_Dies,_Who_Tells_Your_Story)").

### Main Character Backgrounds:

#### Alexander Hamilton

**Alexander Hamilton** (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was an American statesman, politician, legal scholar, military commander, lawyer, banker, and economist. He was one of the [Founding Fathers of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States). He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution), as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the [Federalist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party), the [United States Coast Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard), and the _[New York Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post)_ newspaper.

As the first [Secretary of the Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury), Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington)'s administration. He took the lead in the Federal government's funding of the states' debts, as well as establishing a [national bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States), a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.

His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, a national bank and support for manufacturing, and a strong military. [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson) was his leading opponent, arguing for [agrarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarianism) and smaller government.

#### Aaron Burr

**Aaron Burr Jr.** (February 6, 1756 – September 14, 1836) was an American politician and lawyer. He was the third [vice president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president_of_the_United_States) (1801–1805), serving during President [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson)'s first term.

Burr served as a [Continental Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army) officer in the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War), after which he became a successful lawyer and politician. He was elected twice to the [New York State Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Assembly) (1784–1785, 1798–1799),[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOffice_of_Art_and_Archives-1) was appointed New York State Attorney General (1789–1791), was chosen as a U.S. senator (1791–1797) from the State of New York, and reached the apex of his career as vice president. In the waning months of his tenure as president of the Senate, he oversaw the 1805 impeachment trial of Supreme Court Justice [Samuel Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Chase).

As campaign manager for the [Democratic-Republican party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_party) during the [presidential election of 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election), Burr (along with his unofficial campaign team, known as the Little Band)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr#cite_note-2) was responsible for the first open, public political campaign.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr#cite_note-3)[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr#cite_note-4)[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr#cite_note-5)

Burr shot his political rival [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton) in [an 1804 duel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr–Hamilton_duel), during the last full year of his single term as vice president. He was never tried for the illegal duel and all charges against him were eventually dropped, but Hamilton's death ended Burr's political career.

Burr left Washington, D.C., and traveled west seeking new opportunies, both economic and political—as well as refuge from the controversy surrounding him in the rest of the country. His activities eventually led to his arrest on [charges of treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_conspiracy) in 1807. He was tried and acquitted multiple times, but the fallout left him with large debts and few influential friends. To avoid vigilante execution and further charges by the state, he left the United States for Europe. He remained overseas until 1812, when he returned to the United States to practice law in New York City. He spent the rest of his life there in relative obscurity.

#### Eliza Schuyler

**Elizabeth Hamilton** (née **Schuyler** [/ˈskaɪlər/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); August 9, 1757 – November 9, 1854[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Schuyler_Hamilton#cite_note-1)), also called **Eliza** or **Betsey**, was the wife of American [founding father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States) [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton), a defender of his works, a mother and co-founder and deputy director of [Graham Windham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Windham), the first private orphanage in New York City.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Schuyler_Hamilton#cite_note-turner-2) Eliza is recognized as an early American philanthropist in regards to her work with the Orphan Asylum Society.

Eliza is portrayed in the 2015 [Broadway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre) musical _[Hamilton](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)>)_. The role was originated by [Phillipa Soo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillipa_Soo), who received a 2016 [Tony Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Musical) nomination for her work in the show.[[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Schuyler_Hamilton#cite_note-50) Eliza's depiction in the musical has attracted praise from critics and commentators for emphasizing both her importance in her husband's life and her own work in propagating his legacy, an approach it shares with its inspiration and source, [Ron Chernow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Chernow)'s 2004 biography of Alexander Hamilton.[[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Schuyler_Hamilton#cite_note-henderson-51)

Eliza remained dedicated to preserving her husband's legacy. She re-organized all of Alexander's letters, papers, and writings with the help of her son, [John Church Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Church_Hamilton),and persevered through many setbacks in getting his biography published. With Eliza's help John C. Hamilton would go on to publish *History of the Republic of the United States America, as Traced in the Writings of Alexander Hamilton and his Contemporaries. History of the Republic*would set the bar for future biographies of Alexander Hamilton that would grow as time went on. She was so devoted to Alexander's writings that she wore a small package around her neck containing the pieces of a sonnet that Alexander wrote for her during the early days of their courtship. The writings that historians have today by Alexander Hamilton can be attributed to efforts from Eliza. In June of 1848 When Eliza was in her nineties she made an effort for Congress to buy and publish her late husband's works. In August her request was granted and Congress bought and published Alexander's works, adding them to the library of Congress and helping future historians of Hamilton view his works today. Along with getting Alexander's works stored while Eliza was in her 90's she remained dedicated to charity work, and after moving to Washington, D.C., she helped [Dolley Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolley_Madison)and [Louisa Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisa_Adams) raise money to build the [Washington Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument). Tomb at Trinity Church

#### George Washington

**George Washington** (February 22, 1732[[b\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#cite_note-calendar-6) – December 14, 1799) was an American political leader, military general, statesman, and [Founding Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States) who served as the first [president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) from 1789 to 1797. Previously, he led [Patriot](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)>) forces to victory in the nation's [War for Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War). He presided at the [Constitutional Convention](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)>) of 1787, which established the [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States) and a federal government. Washington has been called the "[Father of His Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_the_Nation)" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the new nation.

Washington received his initial military training and command with the [Virginia Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Regiment) during the [French and Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War). He was later elected to the [Virginia House of Burgesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Burgesses) and was named a delegate to the [Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress), where he was appointed [Commanding General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_General_of_the_United_States_Army) of the [Continental Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army). He commanded American forces, allied with France, in the defeat and surrender of the British during the [Siege of Yorktown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown). He resigned his commission after the [Treaty of Paris](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)>) in 1783.

Washington played a key role in adopting and ratifying the [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution) and was then elected president (twice) by the [Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College). He implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson) and [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton). During the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution), he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the [Jay Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty). He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including the title "President of the United States", and his [Farewell Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington's_Farewell_Address) is widely regarded as a pre-eminent statement on [republicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism).

[Washington owned slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_and_slavery), and in order to preserve national unity he supported measures passed by Congress to protect slavery. He later became troubled with the institution of [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States) and freed his slaves in a 1799 will. He endeavored to assimilate [Native Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States) into Anglo-American culture but combated indigenous resistance during occasions of violent conflict. He was a member of the Anglican Church and the [Freemasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry), and he urged broad religious freedom in his roles as general and president. Upon his death, he was eulogized as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen". He has been memorialized by monuments, art, geographical locations, stamps, and currency, and many scholars and polls rank him among [the greatest American presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States).

#### Thomas Jefferson

**Thomas Jefferson** (April 13, 1743[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson#cite_note-1) – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and [Founding Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States) who served as the third [president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) from 1801 to 1809. He previously served as the second [vice president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president_of_the_United_States) from 1797 to 1801. The principal author of the [Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence), Jefferson was a proponent of democracy, [republicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism), and individual rights, motivating [American colonists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies) to break from the [Kingdom of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain) and form a new nation; he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level.

During the [American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution), he represented [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia) in the [Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress) that adopted the Declaration, drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator, and served as the second [Governor of Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia) from 1779 to 1781, during the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War). He became the United States Minister to France in May 1785, and subsequently, the nation's first [secretary of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State) under President [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington) from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison) organized the [Democratic-Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party) to oppose the [Federalist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party) during the formation of the [First Party System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Party_System). With Madison, he anonymously wrote the provocative [Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_and_Virginia_Resolutions) in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen [states' rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States'_rights) by nullifying the federal [Alien and Sedition Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts).

As president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against [Barbary pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_pirates) and aggressive British trade policies. He also organized the [Louisiana Purchase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase), almost doubling the country's territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was [reelected in 1804](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1804_United_States_presidential_election). Jefferson's second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president [Aaron Burr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr). American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the [Embargo Act of 1807](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargo_Act_of_1807), in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. In 1803, Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribe removal to the newly organized [Louisiana Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Territory), and he signed the [Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves) in 1807. After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the [University of Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia).

Jefferson, while primarily a [planter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantations_in_the_American_South#Plantation_owner), lawyer and politician, mastered many disciplines, which ranged from surveying and mathematics to [horticulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture) and mechanics. He was an architect in the [classical tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_architecture). Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his presidency of the [American Philosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society); he shunned organized religion but was influenced by both Christianity and [deism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism). A [philologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology), Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people. His only full-length book is _[Notes on the State of Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_State_of_Virginia)_ (1785), considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson#cite_note-2)

Although Jefferson is regarded as a leading spokesman for democracy and republicanism in the era of the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment), some modern scholarship has been critical of Jefferson, finding a contradiction between his ownership and trading of many slaves that worked his plantations, and his famous declaration that "all men are created equal". Although the matter remains a subject of debate, most historians believe that Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his slave [Sally Hemings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings), a mixed-race woman who was a half-sister to his late wife and that he fathered at least one of her children. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia. Jefferson continues to [rank highly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States) among U.S. presidents.
